In lean we represent: (1) propositions as
types and (2) predicates as parameterized
propositions.

A parameterized type gives rise to a whole
family of proposition, once for each value
of each parameter.

We can think of one-parameter predicates 
as specifying *properties* of objects. As
an example, as defined, is_even : ℕ → Prop
expresses the property of a natural number
(an argument value) "being even". We define
the constructors to ensure that there is a
proof of (is_even n) if and only if (n : ℕ)
is (a term that represents) an even number.

One-parameter predicates thus also specify 
*sets* of objects: namely all and only those
values of a given argument type that have the 
specified property as shown by the existence
of a proof that such a value "satisfies the 
predicate" (makes the resulting proposition
true).

The is_even predicate thus specifies the
set of all even natural numbers, which we
can write as {0, 2, 4, 6, ...} or, better,
as { n : ℕ | is_even n }.

We can think of two-parameter predicates as 
specifying binary relations, that is, sets of
*pairs* of argument values that make a given
proposition true.

The most commonplace example of a two-argument
predicate is equals. We can write (_ = _) to 
make it clear that equals takes two values and
yields a proposition that the first equals the
second. For example, if a and b are of type ℕ, 
then (a = b) is a proposition that has a proof
if and only if the two terms really are equal
(when reduced). So, for example, 4 = 2 + 2 is
true, there is a proof of it, because reducing
2 + 2 to 4 reduces the whole proposition to 
4 = 4, and there is a proof of this proposition.

The proposition, a = b, in Lean is just a nice
shorthand notation for (eq a b). The two-place
predicate, eq, implements the equality relation. 
It's polymorphic: it takes a *type parameter*, α,
implicitly. It then explicitly takes two values,
a and b, of type α, and yields the proposition, 
a = b (which is of course itself a type).

The eq "type builder" (taking α and two values,
a and b of type α) and yielding the proposition
(a type), a = b, provides a single constructor
with which to build proofs. It's called refl,
and it establishes the "reflexive" property of
the eq relation, by taking *any* value, a : α,
for any type, α, and by returning a proof of
(eq a a), that is, of a = a. So, by applying
eq.refl to any value, a, of any type, we get
a proof of (a = a), and those are the *only*
proofs of equality that can be constructed.
There's thus no way to prove that 0 = 1, for
example, because those terms don't reduce to
the same values, and we can only use eq.refl
to construct proofs that two terms are equal
if they really do reduce to exactly the same
value.

Finally, we will represent some, but no all,
of the logical connetives, including "and",
"or", and "iff", as polymorphic propositions.
Whereas a predicate, such as eq, will take
values of arbitrary types as arguments (e.g.,
eq can take values of type ℕ), connectives
are like polymorphic types: they take types
as arguments, but in this case the types are
of type Prop.

Consider "and" for example. If P and Q are
any two pre-existing propositions (types of
type Prop), then we can form the proposition,
P ∧ Q, and it, too, will be a proposition (a
type of type, Prop). The type of "and" is thus
Prop → Prop → Prop: it takes two propositions
(types of type Prop) as arguments and yields
a new proposition (a new type of type Prop).

To enforce the logical meaning of "and", we
define the "and" type builder to have just
one constructor, which we call "intro", that
if applied to a proof, p, of P and to a proof,
q, of Q yields a term, (and.intro p q), that
is axiomatically accepted as being a "proof"
of (and P Q), which we write using an infix
notation as (P ∧ Q). 

Finally, we note that if we're given a term,
(and.intro p q), of type (P ∧ Q), that is, if
we're given a proof of (P ∧ Q), we can get a
proof of P from it, by "destructuring" the
term using pattern matching. For example, we
can obtain "p" (the proof of P "contained 
inside" the proof of P ∧ Q) with the following
rule: | (and.intro p _) := p. This is how we
implement the two "elimination rules" for and.

1. State and prove the proposition that the
string,"Lean!", appended to the string, "Hello, "
is equal to the string, "Hello, Lean!". You may
and should use the Lean library-provided string 
append operator, ++, as an infix notation for 
append.

2.  Sometimes we want to state and prove a 
proposition without binding a name to the proof.
For that, instead of using def, theorem, or
lemma, we can use "example." Here's an example.

as well.

4. Complete the following program to show that
if P and Q are arbitrary propositions, and *if* 
you're given a proof of P and Q, then you can 
obtain and return a proof of P.

Hint: In Lean, and.intro is the one introduction
(proof creating) rule for and, and and.elim_left
and and.elim_right are the two elimination rules.
They are functions. Use one of them!
